The **Minecraft server monitor for Windows** is installed along side Minecraft and enables:

  * A remote interface which can be connected to via telnet
  * Period backups of the game world (issues a save-all command, waits for it to finish, then does the backup)
  * Open-sourced for commercial and non-commercial work. Allows derivative works.

The tool is written with complete transparency for the game - If the game is ever updated, your monitor will continue to work without changes. This only works on Windows.

**A great tool for Linux** can be found at [minecraftmonitor.com](http://www.minecraftmonitor.com/)
